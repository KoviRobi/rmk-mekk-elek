# RMK Mekk Elek
This is my currently WIP keyboard firmware, written in rust.

"RMK" stands for "Rust Mechanical Keyboard" as well as being my initials.
But that's a generic name, I'm sure there are other rust mechanical keyboard firmwares,
so "Mekk Elek" is just a TV show I used to enjoy when I was a kid.
Not necessarily a great name, given Mekk Elek was a DIYer who wasn't very good, but
it should serve as a warning that this is a hobbyist project, that I'm writing for fun,
not because currently I use it (I have not got around to finishing the keyboard I started
writing this for -- currently I still use my ErgoDox which has QMK on it).

This should also serve as a disclaimer -- I make no promises about this software and accept
no liability.

However if you do find this useful, I'd be curious, just drop me a line, or start a GitHub
discussion, etc.
